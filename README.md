# DataGatherer

This project is aimed at the creation of a software that allows for sem i-automatic extraction of specific data from a given set of images.

## A word of caution

*This software has been written in the least time possible. There are still bugs bad and code standard is low.
It may not be improved.
Caution and frequent backing-up is advised.*

## Requirements

You need Docker installed.

## Result

You will be able to get a matrix:

|           | user_1    | user_2 | ... | user_3    |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----|-----------|
| hashtag_1 | weight_11 |        |     |           |
| hashtag_2 |           |        |     |           |
| hashtag_n |           |        |     | weight_nn |

where weight = in how many posts a user has used the hashtag?
